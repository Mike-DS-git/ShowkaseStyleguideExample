 * This code runs whenever the composable is recomposed, which includes the initial composition and any
 * subsequent recompositions due to state changes.

 * This code will execute before the composable has completed its layout pass and before other side effects.

 * This is efficient because it avoids unnecessary recalculations if the count.value remains the same.

/**
 * 7. SideEffect
 * SideEffect: Executes a block of code every time the composable is recomposed, and is generally used
 * for non-UI related side effects.
 *
 * The code inside SideEffect runs after the composable has been fully committed to the composition,
 * meaning it runs after the layout pass and the composable has been rendered.
 *
 * SideEffect is useful for operations that need to be in sync with the final layout state of the composable.
 * This is particularly important for tasks like sending analytics events or triggering external side effects that rely on the final state of the UI.
